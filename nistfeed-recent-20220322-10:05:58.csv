CVE-2021-46390;N/A;2022-03-21T20:15Z;An access control issue in the authentication module of Lexar_F35 v1.0.34 allows attackers to access sensitive data and cause a Denial of Service (DoS). An attacker without access to securely protected data on a secure USB flash drive can bypass user authentication without having any information related to the password of the registered user. The secure USB flash drive transmits the password entered by the user to the authentication module in the drive after the user registers a password, and then the input password is compared with the registered password stored in the authentication module. Subsequently, the module returns the comparison result for the authentication decision. Therefore, an attacker can bypass password authentication by analyzing the functions that return the password verification or comparison results and manipulate the authentication result values. Accordingly, even if attackers enter an incorrect password, they can be authenticated as a legitimate user and can therefore exploit functions of the secure USB flash drive by manipulating the authentication result values.
CVE-2022-24775;N/A;2022-03-21T19:15Z;guzzlehttp/psr7 is a PSR-7 HTTP message library. Versions prior to 1.8.4 and 2.1.1 are vulnerable to improper header parsing.

CVE-2022-24766;N/A;2022-03-21T19:15Z;mitmproxy is an interactive, SSL/TLS-capable intercepting proxy. In mitmproxy 7.0.4 and below, a malicious client or server is able to perform HTTP request smuggling attacks through mitmproxy. This means that a malicious client/server could smuggle a request/response through mitmproxy as part of another request/response's HTTP message body. While mitmproxy would only see one request, the target server would see multiple requests. A smuggled request is still captured as part of another request's body, but it does not appear in the request list and does not go through the usual mitmproxy event hooks, where users may have implemented custom access control checks or input sanitization. Unless mitmproxy is used to protect an HTTP/1 service, no action is required. The vulnerability has been fixed in mitmproxy 8.0.0 and above. There are currently no known workarounds.

CVE-2022-24761;N/A;2022-03-17T13:15Z;Waitress is a Web Server Gateway Interface server for Python 2 and 3. When using Waitress versions 2.1.0 and prior behind a proxy that does not properly validate the incoming HTTP request matches the RFC7230 standard, Waitress and the frontend proxy may disagree on where one request starts and where it ends. This would allow requests to be smuggled via the front-end proxy to waitress and later behavior. There are two classes of vulnerability that may lead to request smuggling that are addressed by this advisory: The use of Python's `int()` to parse strings into integers, leading to `+10` to be parsed as `10`, or `0x01` to be parsed as `1`, where as the standard specifies that the string should contain only digits or hex digits; and Waitress does not support chunk extensions, however it was discarding them without validating that they did not contain illegal characters. This vulnerability has been patched in Waitress 2.1.1. A workaround is available. When deploying a proxy in front of waitress, turning on any and all functionality to make sure that the request matches the RFC7230 standard. Certain proxy servers may not have this functionality though and users are encouraged to upgrade to the latest version of waitress instead.

CVE-2022-23610;N/A;2022-03-16T18:15Z;wire-server provides back end services for Wire, an open source messenger. In versions of wire-server prior to the 2022-01-27 release, it was possible to craft DSA Signatures to bypass SAML SSO and impersonate any Wire user with SAML credentials. In teams with SAML, but without SCIM, it was possible to create new accounts with fake SAML credentials. Under certain conditions that can be established by an attacker, an upstream library for parsing, rendering, signing, and validating SAML XML data was accepting public keys as trusted that were provided by the attacker in the signature. As a consequence, the attacker could login as any user in any Wire team with SAML SSO enabled. If SCIM was not enabled, the attacker could also create new users with new SAML NameIDs. In order to exploit this vulnerability, the attacker needs to know the SSO login code (distributed to all team members with SAML credentials and visible in the Team Management app), the SAML EntityID identifying the IdP (a URL not considered sensitive, but usually hard to guess, also visible in Team Management), and the SAML NameID of the user (usually an email address or a nick). The issue has been fixed in wire-server `2022-01-27` and is already deployed on all Wire managed services. On premise instances of wire-server need to be updated to `2022-01-27`, so that their backends are no longer affected. There are currently no known workarounds. More detailed information about how to reproduce the vulnerability and mitigation strategies is available in the GitHub Security Advisory.

CVE-2022-22771;N/A;2022-03-15T17:15Z;The Server component of TIBCO Software Inc.'s TIBCO JasperReports Library, TIBCO JasperReports Library for ActiveMatrix BPM, TIBCO JasperReports Server, TIBCO JasperReports Server for AWS Marketplace, TIBCO JasperReports Server for ActiveMatrix BPM, and TIBCO JasperReports Server for Microsoft Azure contains a directory-traversal vulnerability that may theoretically allow web server users to access contents of the host system. Affected releases are TIBCO Software Inc.'s TIBCO JasperReports Library: version 7.9.0, TIBCO JasperReports Library for ActiveMatrix BPM: version 7.9.0, TIBCO JasperReports Server: versions 7.9.0 and 7.9.1, TIBCO JasperReports Server for AWS Marketplace: versions 7.9.0 and 7.9.1, TIBCO JasperReports Server for ActiveMatrix BPM: versions 7.9.0 and 7.9.1, and TIBCO JasperReports Server for Microsoft Azure: version 7.9.1.
CVE-2022-0970;N/A;2022-03-15T17:15Z;Cross-site Scripting (XSS) - Stored in GitHub repository getgrav/grav prior to 1.7.31.
CVE-2022-0778;7.5;2022-03-15T17:15Z;The BN_mod_sqrt() function, which computes a modular square root, contains a bug that can cause it to loop forever for non-prime moduli. Internally this function is used when parsing certificates that contain elliptic curve public keys in compressed form or explicit elliptic curve parameters with a base point encoded in compressed form. It is possible to trigger the infinite loop by crafting a certificate that has invalid explicit curve parameters. Since certificate parsing happens prior to verification of the certificate signature, any process that parses an externally supplied certificate may thus be subject to a denial of service attack. The infinite loop can also be reached when parsing crafted private keys as they can contain explicit elliptic curve parameters. Thus vulnerable situations include: - TLS clients consuming server certificates - TLS servers consuming client certificates - Hosting providers taking certificates or private keys from customers - Certificate authorities parsing certification requests from subscribers - Anything else which parses ASN.1 elliptic curve parameters Also any other applications that use the BN_mod_sqrt() where the attacker can control the parameter values are vulnerable to this DoS issue. In the OpenSSL 1.0.2 version the public key is not parsed during initial parsing of the certificate which makes it slightly harder to trigger the infinite loop. However any operation which requires the public key from the certificate will trigger the infinite loop. In particular the attacker can use a self-signed certificate to trigger the loop during verification of the certificate signature. This issue affects OpenSSL versions 1.0.2, 1.1.1 and 3.0. It was addressed in the releases of 1.1.1n and 3.0.2 on the 15th March 2022. Fixed in OpenSSL 3.0.2 (Affected 3.0.0,3.0.1). Fixed in OpenSSL 1.1.1n (Affected 1.1.1-1.1.1m). Fixed in OpenSSL 1.0.2zd (Affected 1.0.2-1.0.2zc).

CVE-2022-26779;N/A;2022-03-15T16:15Z;Apache CloudStack prior to 4.16.1.0 used insecure random number generation for project invitation tokens. If a project invite is created based only on an email address, a random token is generated. An attacker with knowledge of the project ID and the fact that the invite is sent, could generate time deterministic tokens and brute force attempt to use them prior to the legitimate receiver accepting the invite. This feature is not enabled by default, the attacker is required to know or guess the project ID for the invite in addition to the invitation token, and the attacker would need to be an existing authorized user of CloudStack.

CVE-2022-24756;N/A;2022-03-15T15:15Z;Bareos is open source software for backup, archiving, and recovery of data for operating systems. When Bareos Director >= 18.2 but prior to 21.1.0, 20.0.6, and 19.2.12 is built and configured for PAM authentication, a failed PAM authentication will leak a small amount of memory. An attacker that is able to use the PAM Console (i.e. by knowing the shared secret or via the WebUI) can flood the Director with failing login attempts which will eventually lead to an out-of-memory condition in which the Director will not work anymore. Bareos Director versions 21.1.0, 20.0.6 and 19.2.12 contain a Bugfix for this problem. Users who are unable to upgrade may disable PAM authentication as a workaround.
CVE-2022-24755;N/A;2022-03-15T15:15Z;Bareos is open source software for backup, archiving, and recovery of data for operating systems. When Bareos Director >= 18.2 >= 18.2 but prior to 21.1.0, 20.0.6, and 19.2.12 is built and configured for PAM authentication, it will skip authorization checks completely. Expired accounts and accounts with expired passwords can still login. This problem will affect users that have PAM enabled. Currently there is no authorization (e.g. check for expired or disabled accounts), but only plain authentication (i.e. check if username and password match). Bareos Director versions 21.1.0, 20.0.6 and 19.2.12 implement the authorization check that was previously missing. The only workaround is to make sure that authentication fails if the user is not authorized.
CVE-2022-24752;N/A;2022-03-15T15:15Z;SyliusGridBundle is a package of generic data grids for Symfony applications. Prior to versions 1.10.1 and 1.11-rc2, values added at the end of query sorting were passed directly to the database. The maintainers do not know if this could lead to direct SQL injections but took steps to remediate the vulnerability. The issue is fixed in versions 1.10.1 and 1.11-rc2. As a workaround, overwrite the`Sylius\Component\Grid\Sorting\Sorter.php` class and register it in the container. More information about this workaround is available in the GitHub Security Advisory.

CVE-2022-24721;N/A;2022-03-15T14:15Z;CometD is a scalable comet implementation for web messaging. In any version prior to 5.0.11, 6.0.6, and 7.0.6, internal usage of Oort and Seti channels is improperly authorized, so any remote user could subscribe and publish to those channels. By subscribing to those channels, a remote user may be able to watch cluster-internal traffic that contains other users' (possibly sensitive) data. By publishing to those channels, a remote user may be able to create/modify/delete other user's data and modify the cluster structure. A fix is available in versions 5.0.11, 6.0.6, and 7.0.6. As a workaround, install a custom `SecurityPolicy` that forbids subscription and publishing to remote, non-Oort, sessions on Oort and Seti channels.

CVE-2022-24762;6.5;2022-03-14T23:15Z;sysend.js is a library that allows a user to send messages between pages that are open in the same browser. Users that use cross-origin communication may have their communications intercepted. Impact is limited by the communication occurring in the same browser. This issue has been patched in sysend.js version 1.10.0. The only currently known workaround is to avoid sending communications that a user does not want to have intercepted via sysend messages.
CVE-2022-24740;N/A;2022-03-14T23:15Z;Volto is a ReactJS-based frontend for the Plone Content Management System. Between versions 14.0.0-alpha.5 and 15.0.0-alpha.0, a user could have their authentication cookie replaced with an authentication cookie from another user, effectively giving them control of the other user's account and privileges. This occurs when using an outdated version of the `react-cookie` library and a server is under high load. A proof of concept does not currently exist, but it is possible for this issue to occur in the wild. The patch and fix is present in Volto 15.0.0-alpha.0. As a workaround, one may manually upgrade the `react-cookie` package to 4.1.1 and then override all Volto components that use this library.

CVE-2022-24749;N/A;2022-03-14T22:15Z;Sylius is an open source eCommerce platform. In versions prior to 1.9.10, 1.10.11, and 1.11.2, it is possible to upload an SVG file containing cross-site scripting (XSS) code in the admin panel. In order to perform a XSS attack, the file itself has to be open in a new card or loaded outside of the IMG tag. The problem applies both to the files opened on the admin panel and shop pages. The issue is fixed in versions 1.9.10, 1.10.11, and 1.11.2. As a workaround, require a library that adds on-upload file sanitization and overwrite the service before writing the file to the filesystem. The GitHub Security Advisory contains more specific information about the workaround.

CVE-2022-24733;N/A;2022-03-14T19:15Z;Sylius is an open source eCommerce platform. Prior to versions 1.9.10, 1.10.11, and 1.11.2, it is possible for a page controlled by an attacker to load the website within an iframe. This will enable a clickjacking attack, in which the attacker's page overlays the target application's interface with a different interface provided by the attacker. The issue is fixed in versions 1.9.10, 1.10.11, and 1.11.2. A workaround is available. Every response from app should have an X-Frame-Options header set to: ``sameorigin``. To achieve that, add a new `subscriber` in the app.
CVE-2022-24578;N/A;2022-03-14T19:15Z;GPAC 1.0.1 is affected by a heap-based buffer overflow in SFS_AddString () at bifs/script_dec.c.
CVE-2022-20001;N/A;2022-03-14T19:15Z;fish is a command line shell. fish version 3.1.0 through version 3.3.1 is vulnerable to arbitrary code execution. git repositories can contain per-repository configuration that change the behavior of git, including running arbitrary commands. When using the default configuration of fish, changing to a directory automatically runs `git` commands in order to display information about the current repository in the prompt. If an attacker can convince a user to change their current directory into one controlled by the attacker, such as on a shared file system or extracted archive, fish will run arbitrary commands under the attacker's control. This problem has been fixed in fish 3.4.0. Note that running git in these directories, including using the git tab completion, remains a potential trigger for this issue. As a workaround, remove the `fish_git_prompt` function from the prompt.
